## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file if your Firebase project needs local configuration. The app expects Firebase configuration inside the client setup in `src/lib/firebase.ts`.

## Deployment on Vercel

This project is configured for Vercel with `vercel.json`.

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- SPA routing: handled by rewrite to `index.html`

Deploy by connecting the repository to Vercel or using the Vercel CLI.

## Notes

- Routes are protected where needed.
- Some sections use fallback content when Firestore permissions are restricted.
- The app is built as a single-page application, so route rewrites are required in production hosting.
